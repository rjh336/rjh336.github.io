Thanks for visiting my site! If you are on this page you are probably wondering who the heck I am, so here we go...

## Bio

I am a South Florida transplant currently living in New York City, where in 2014 I graduated from **New York University** with a BBA in Finance and Information Systems. From 2014 to 2017 I worked as a management consultant at **KPMG** focusing on delivering timely and accurate reporting and analytics systems to several Fortune 500 clients. While my experiences at KPMG taught me invaluable project/client management skills and a high-level understanding of the Enterprise Performance Life Cycle, I was more interested in fulfilling my clients' thirst for innovative technology that leverages data to uncover business insights. At the same time I had a hunger to learn how I could utilize advanced computing frameworks, machine learning and web technologies to create cool data science projects of my own. Thus, I decided it was time for a change.  

In August of 2017 I decided to enroll in the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) data science bootcamp with the goal of getting hands-on experience with machine learning, data mining, data visualization, and web development. The bootcamp has given me the tools to build worthwhile projects, and the confidence to pursue my passion for learning and working in the growing data science industry.

## Other Interests

In addition to being a data scientist, I am also a music lover. I enjoy being a jack of all instruments and creating cheasy, but catchy tunes that you can listen to [here](https://dinosoarpawnshop.bandcamp.com/).
